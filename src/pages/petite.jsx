              I mapped out the usersâ€™ steps to see how I could clarify their
              journey to ensure that the product meets all the needs of the

              The steps of the user journey were determined by breaking down the

              general emotions and thoughts.

            During this project, I learned how much needs to be sketched and
            planned out before. This was the first time I did a project on this
            scale, and I struggled with the prototyping because I didn't plan
            everything with enough detail, to begin with.
